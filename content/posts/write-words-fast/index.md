Writing is really hard. Despite having
[plenty of time on my hands](https://www.google.com/search?q=coronavirus), I
find myself stagnating when I try to write blog posts. The problem is that I'm
aiming too high. I want my first blog post to be the most immaculate piece of
literature you've ever laid your eyes on.

Not gonna happen.

So here's the new plan: I write a lot, all the time. Not every post will be
good. That's okay; I'm learning. There's a famous parable about this that
[I'm](https://stratechery.com/2015/buzzfeed-important-news-organization-world/)
[told](https://blog.codinghorror.com/quantity-always-trumps-quality/) comes from
the book [Art and Fear](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0961454733/),
which I haven't read. It goes like this:

> The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class
> into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be
> graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right
> solely on its quality.
>
> His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his
> bathroom scales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group: fifty pound of
> pots rated an “A”, forty pounds a “B”, and so on. Those being graded on
> “quality”, however, needed to produce only one pot – albeit a perfect one – to
> get an “A”.
>
> Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest
> quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems
> that while the “quantity” group was busily churning out piles of work – and
> learning from their mistakes – the “quality” group had sat theorizing about
> perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than
> grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.

This story almost certainly didn't happen, but it holds a key truth: Learning
takes place during trial and error. Making lots of stuff is the way to get
better. Eight-year-old me
[had this figured out](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/PullJosh/projects/?page=last),
but it's a lesson I've slowly forgotten.

So I'm going to write a lot, and see what sticks. Who knows? Maybe I'll even get
lucky and write something _good_.

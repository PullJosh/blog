Zeit just released a
[crazy new pricing model](https://zeit.co/blog/simpler-pricing) for the Now
hosting service.

<TwitterTweetEmbed tweetId="1247995038799462401" />

Under the new model, users don't pay more for increased usage. That's insane,
right? They're a _hosting company_. The entire service is just renting
computers. Users should pay based on how much they use those computers!

Nope.

This new model is a vast improvement. The crucial benefit is its simplicity.
It's impossible to get confused. It costs $20/month per seat, and it's free for
individuals. That's it.

Is this totally _fair_? Probably not. Not every customer will be charged exactly
the right amount. But that's okay! The value of simplicity (for both consumers
and for Zeit internally) far outweighs any of the downsides.

What about customers who are being overcharged? Not a problem. Simplifying the
system frees up time that would usually be spent on customer support and
billing. This saves money, and that money can be used to round down the price of
the service. Even the people paying the most relative to their usage will be
paying a fair price because the simplicity of the service allows it to be cheap
for everyone.

This is the same reason that
[Universal Basic Income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income) is an
excellent idea. By simplifying the model for distributing money to citizens,
resources that would usually be spent on management (such as means testing) can
go directly to the people.

This is also why a basic income _must_ be unconditional. It's easy and fun to
argue that [Jeffy B](https://www.google.com/search?q=jeff+bezos+net+worth)
should not receive basic income, but the overhead that's introduced as soon as
qualifications are added completely destroys the simplicity of UBIâ€”its primary
benefit.

The simple system always wins.

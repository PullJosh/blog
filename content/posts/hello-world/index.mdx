Hey folks! I'm putting together a new joshuapullen.com. You're looking at
version 1.0 right now. There aren't any real blog posts yet, but I'm planning to
write lots soon.

I'm setting up an email list. Eventually there will be a fancy sign up form, but
for now you can shoot me an email at `hello@joshuapullen.com` if you want to be
notified when I write stuff.

Have a great life!

\- Josh

Education hasn't changed much lately. The "knowledge factory" model seen in most
schools is outdated. Times have changed, but our model of education hasn't.

In a future post I'd like to articulate more precisely what's wrong with school,
but everyone who has completed a traditional K-12 education has a sense that
school isn't what it could be. Boredom. Endless homework. Big tests. We can do
better.

It's important to note that most issues are not the fault of individual people,
but the system itself. The structure of education needs to change.

Unfortunately, change is difficult. Technology improves fastest in areas where
experimentation is easy. Changing education is hard, because getting it right is
too important. Nobody wants their kid to be the one who makes the sacrifice to
try a new experimental approach. This
[dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteer%27s_dilemma) leads to a
perverse set of incentives that keep our most important institutions stagnant.

To improve education, experiments need to take place on a small scale at the
[fringes](https://www.perell.com/blog/where-the-wild-things-are). Home-school
parents, [experimental schools](https://lambdaschool.com/), and extracurricular
activities are willing to take risks, so change must begin there. Ideas that
succeed can then be brought — slowly and painfully — into the mainstream.

This won't be an easy process, but it needs to happen. We are at the very
beginning of a new wave. It will be many years until big change reaches the
masses, but now is the time for ambitious, experimental educators to step up to
the plate.
